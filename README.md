# Investigation into Goal Scoring in International Soccer  

## Overview  

As a sports journalist specializing in soccer analysis, you aim to investigate an intriguing question: Are more goals scored in women's international soccer matches than in men's? This analysis presents an exciting opportunity for an in-depth article that your subscribers will find captivating.  

## Project Background  

The sport of soccer has evolved significantly, with various factors influencing goal scoring trends. To ensure a valid basis for your investigation, you decide to focus solely on official FIFA World Cup matches since January 1, 2002, excluding qualifiers. This approach allows for a more consistent comparison between men's and women's international soccer performances.  

## Datasets  

You have created two datasets containing the results of every official men's and women's international football match:  

- **women_results.csv**: Contains match results for women's international soccer matches.  
- **men_results.csv**: Contains match results for men's international soccer matches.  

These datasets were scraped from reliable online sources and include match statistics relevant to your analysis.  

## Research Question  

**Are more goals scored in women's international soccer matches than men's?**  

## Hypothesis Testing  

To determine the statistical validity of your assumption, I performed a hypothesis test with the following:  

### Null Hypothesis (H0)  
The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as in men's.  

### Alternative Hypothesis (HA)  
The mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is greater than in men's.  

### Significance Level  
A significance level of 10% (Î± = 0.10) will be employed for the hypothesis test.  

## Methodology  

1. **Data Cleaning**: Load and preprocess both datasets to ensure the necessary information is available for analysis.  
2. **Data Exploration**: Explore the datasets to understand their structure, contents, and any additional variables that could be relevant.  
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Perform a suitable statistical test (e.g., a two-sample t-test) to evaluate the null hypothesis against the alternative hypothesis.  
4. **Result Interpretation**: Analyze the test results to draw conclusions about the hypothesis.  

## Expected Outcomes  

- Statistical evidence supporting or refuting the assumption that more goals are scored in women's international soccer matches than in men's.  
- Insightful analysis that can be presented in a compelling article for your audience.  

## Conclusion  

This investigation into the goal-scoring patterns in men's and women's international soccer matches aims to provide a data-backed perspective for sports reporting, offering valuable insights for fans and analysts alike.
